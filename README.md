## Installation

To install Mark-rs, you need to have Rust installed on your system. You can install Rust using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/).

### Install via Cargo

Once you have Rust installed, you can install Mark-rs using Cargo:

```bash
cargo install mark-rs
```

**Note**: Make sure to have the `~/.cargo/bin` directory in your `PATH` environment variable so you can run the `markrs` command from anywhere.

If it isn't already in your `PATH`, you can adding the following line to your shell configuration file (e.g., `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.):

```bash:
export PATH="$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH"
```

On Windows, you can add the `C:\Users\your_user\.cargo\bin` directory to your `PATH` environment variable.

### Install via Pre-built Binaries

You can also download pre-built binaries for your platform from the [releases page](https://github.com/zliel/Mark-rs/releases)

From there, you can download the appropriate binary for your operating system and architecture, extract it, and use it directly.

### Updates

If Mark-rs was installed using Cargo, you can update it to the latest version by running:

```bash
cargo install mark-rs
```

If you installed Mark-rs using pre-built binaries, you can download the latest version from the [releases page](https://github.com/zliel/Mark-rs/releases)

## Usage

To use Mark-rs, you can run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
markrs [OPTIONS] <INPUT_DIR>
```

Where `<INPUT_DIR>` is the path to the directory of Markdown files you want to parse. The output will be written to `/output` by default.

### Options

You can also use the following CLI arguments to customize the behavior of Mark-rs:

- `-c, --config <CONFIG>`: Specify a custom configuration file (default: `./config.toml`).
- `-o, --output-dir <OUTPUT_DIR>`: Specify the output directory for the generated HTML files (default: `/output`).
- `-r, --recursive`: Recursively parse all Markdown files in the specified directory and its subdirectories. (default: false if not present)
- `-v, --verbose`: Enable verbose output, which will print additional information while the program is running.
- `-h, --help`: Display help information.
- `-V, --version`: Display the version of Mark-rs.

## Configuration

You can customize Mark-rs's behavior by specifying a config file to use. If a config file is not specified, then the default configuration directory will be checked; if no config file already exists, then the default `config.toml` file will be written.

The default configuration directories (defined by the [`dirs` crate](https://docs.rs/dirs/latest/dirs/) ) are:

| Platform | Value                                 | Example                                             |
| -------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Linux    | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` or `$HOME`/.config | /home/your_user/.config/markrs                      |
| macOS    | `$HOME`/Library/Application Support   | /Users/your_user/Library/Application Support/markrs |
| Windows  | `{FOLDERID_RoamingAppData}`           | C:\Users\your_user\AppData\Roaming\markrs           |

Here is the default configuration:

```toml
# Tokenization
[lexer]
tab_size = 4

# HTML Generation
[html]
css_file = "default" # "default" for the default styles
favicon_file = ""    # Empty for no favicon
use_prism = false    # If "true", the CDN links for PrismJS will be used for codeblock highlighting
# Note that `use_prism = true` this will add `<script>` and `<link>` elements to the page
prism_theme = "vsc-dark-plus" # Will only take effect if "use_prism" is set to "true"
# See https://github.com/PrismJS/prism-themes for themes and https://cdnjs.com/libraries/prism-themes for what to set "prism_theme" to
```

## ⚠️Note: Raw HTML

Mark-rs supports using raw HTML in input Markdown files, but it should be noted that using raw HTML can lead to security vulnerabilities, such as XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attacks, if the input is not properly sanitized. Therefore, it is recommended to use raw HTML with caution and only when necessary.

As of right now, Mark-rs does not sanitize raw HTML, so that users can use things like script tags and embedded content, but do so with caution. For more information on XSS attacks, see [OWASP](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/) and the [OWASP XSS Prevention Cheat Sheet.](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross_Site_Scripting_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html)
